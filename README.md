## üìà Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze data science job salaries to identify key trends, predict compensation based on various factors, and provide visual insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **work_year**: Year of the reported salary.
- **experience_level**: Experience level in the job role (e.g., Junior, Mid-level, Senior).
- **employment_type**: Type of employment (e.g., Full-time, Part-time).
- **job_title**: Job title (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst).
- **salary**: Annual salary in respective currency.
- **salary_currency**: Currency of the salary.
- **salary_in_usd**: Annual salary in USD.
- **employee_residence**: Country of residence of the employee.
- **remote_ratio**: Percentage indicating the amount of remote work (e.g., 0, 50, 100).
- **company_location**: Country where the employer is located.
- **company_size**: Size of the company (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### üîç Data Analysis

- **Tools Used**: SQL, Pandas
- **Process**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
  - Exploratory data analysis to understand salary distribution across different roles, experience levels, and locations.
  - Identification of key factors influencing salary variations.

### ü§ñ Salary Prediction Model

- **Model Used**: Stacked Regression Model (LGBM + XGB + GB)
- **Process**:
  - Engineered the feature `residence_salary_ratio`, boosting the model‚Äôs performance from an R¬≤ of 0.40-0.50 to 0.97 for precise salary predictions.

### üìä Data Visualization

- **Tool Used**: Tableau
- **Dashboard Link**: [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neilansh.chauhan/viz/JobMarketAnalysis_17366805021800/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
- **Process**:
  - Created interactive dashboards to visualize salary trends across different dimensions such as job title, experience level, and location.
  - Enabled stakeholders to interact with data for informed decision-making.

## üèÜ Results

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Identified salary trends based on job titles, experience levels, and geographical locations.
  - Recognized the impact of remote work and company size on compensation.
- **Salary Prediction**:
  - Developed a highly accurate model for predicting salaries based on various factors.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Provided clear visual insights into salary distributions, aiding job seekers and employers in understanding market standards.
